/* This code example requires two I2C ports, one as master and the other one
 * as slave. Set the I2C_MODE macro depending on the kit. Some kits support two
 * I2C ports which you can configure in I2C_MODE_BOTH whereas some support only
 * one port in which case you can configure the kit in either I2C_MODE_MASTER or
 * I2C_MODE_SLAVE. See README.md to know more on the kit specific configuration.
